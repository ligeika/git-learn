The nations search for treasure
And beasts rise from their tombs
Kings revel in triumph
All succumb to shadows in their own turn

The fish spawn, the birds nest
The roses bloom and wither away
The winds lash, the leaves decay
All deaden to ice, covered by snow

See beyond the secrets of space
The four bearers of heaven
Gaze in all directions
The four wise ones stand their ground
Call the stars that shine in their skies
Gaze in all directions

The rivers rush, the lakes they gleam
When summer yields to autumn cold
Moments flee into oblivion
Fading to blue and turn into rime

The first cloaked in clement winds
The second with meadow-scented hair
The third whoâ€™s cold and grey
The fourth who carries the snow away
